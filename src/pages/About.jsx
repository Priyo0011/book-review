        A book is a medium for recording information in the form of writing or
        images. Books are typically composed of many pages, bound together and
        protected by a cover. Modern bound books were preceded by many other
        written mediums, such as the codex and the scroll. The book publishing
        process is the series of steps involved in their creation and
        dissemination. As a conceptual object, a book typically refers to a
        written work of substantial length, which may be distributed either
        physically or in digital forms like ebooks. These works are broadly
        classified into fiction (containing imaginary content) and non-fiction
        (containing content representing truths). Many smaller categories exist
        within these, such as children literature meant to match the reading
        level and interests of children, or reference works that gather
        collections of nonfiction. Books are traded at both regular stores and
        specialized bookstores, and people can borrow them from libraries. The
        reception of books has led to a number of social consequences, including
        censorship. A physical book does not need to contain written works: for
        example, it may contain only drawings, engravings, photographs, puzzles,
        or removable content like paper dolls. Physical books may be left empty
        to be used for writing or drawing, such as account books, appointment
        books, autograph books, notebooks, diaries and sketchbooks. The
        contemporary book industry has seen several major changes due to new
        technologies. In some markets, the sale of printed books has decreased
        due to the increased use of ebooks However, printed books still largely
        outsell ebooks, and many people have a preference for print.The 21st
        century has also seen a rapid rise in the popularity of which are
        recordings of books being read aloud. Additionally, awareness of the
        needs of people who  access print media due to limitations like
        visual impairment has led to a rise in formats designed for greater
        accessibility, such as braille printing or formats supporting
        text-to-voice. Google Books estimated that as of 2010, approximately
        130,000,000 unique books had been published.

        In its modern incarnation, a physical book is typically a collection of
        pages (most commonly of paper, parchment, or vellum) that are bound
        together and protected by a cover. By extension, book may refer to a
        physical book written, printed, or graphic contents. A single part or
        division of a longer written work may also be called a book, especially
        for some works composed in antiquity: each part of Aristotle Physics,
        for example, is a book. It is difficult to create an exact definition of
        books that clearly delineates them from other kinds of written material
        across time and culture: many physical mediums for communication have
        existed throughout history, and the question of whether a particular
        object is a book may be subjective and contentious (as in the case of
        ebooks). Historian of books James Raven has suggested that when studying
        how books have been used to communicate, they should be defined in a
        broadly inclusive way as portable, durable, replicable and legible means
        of recording and disseminating information, rather than by physical or
        contextual features. This would include, for example, ebooks,
        newspapers, and quipus (a form of knot-based recording historically used
        by cultures in Andean South America), but not objects fixed in place
        such as inscribed monuments. Stricter definitions appear in other
        specialized contexts. For the purpose of recording national statistics
        on book production, UNESCO recommended that a book be defined as a
        non-periodical printed publication of at least 49 pages, exclusive of
        the cover pages, published in the country and made available to the
        public distinguishing them from other written material such as
        pamphlets. Although in academic language a monograph is understood to be
        a specialist work on a single subject, in library and information
        science the term is sometimes used more broadly to mean any non-serial
        publication complete in one volume (a physical book) or a definite
        number of volumes (such as a multi-volume novel), in contrast to serial
        or periodical publications.

      <h1 className="font-bold">History of books: </h1>
      <p>
        The history of books became an acknowledged academic discipline in the
        1980s. Contributions to the field have come from textual scholarship,
         bibliography, philology, palaeography, art history, social
        history and cultural history. Its key purpose is to demonstrate that the
        book as an object, not just the text contained within it, is a conduit
        of interaction between readers and words. Analysis of each component
        part of the book reveals its purpose, where and how it was kept, who
        read it, ideological and religious beliefs of the period, and whether
        readers interacted with the text within. Even a lack of evidence of this
        nature leaves valuable clues about the nature of that particular book.
        The earliest forms of writing were etched on stone slabs, transitioning
        to palm leaves and papyrus in ancient times. Parchment and paper
        later emerged as important substrates for bookmaking, introducing
        greater durability and accessibility. Across regions like China, the
        Middle East, Europe, and South Asia, diverse methods of book production
        evolved. The Middle Ages saw the rise of illuminated manuscripts,
        intricately blending text and imagery, particularly during the Mughal
        era in South Asia under the patronage of rulers like Akbar and Shah
        Prior to the invention of the printing press, made famous
        by the Gutenberg Bible, each text was a unique handcrafted valuable
        article, personalized through the design features incorporated by the
        scribe, owner, bookbinder, and illustrator. The invention of the
        printing press in the 15th century marked a pivotal moment,
        revolutionizing book production. Innovations like movable type and
        steam-powered presses accelerated manufacturing processes and
        contributed to increased literacy rates. Copyright protection also
        emerged, securing  rights and shaping the publishing
        landscape.The Late Modern Period introduced chapbooks, catering to
        a wider range of readers, and mechanization of the printing process
        further enhanced efficiency. The 20th century witnessed the advent of
        typewriters, computers, and desktop publishing, transforming document
        creation and printing. Digital advancements in the 21st century led to
        the rise of e-books, propelled by the popularity of e-readers and
        accessibility features. While discussions about the potential decline of
        physical books have surfaced, print media has proven remarkably
        resilient, continuing to thrive as a multi-billion dollar industry.
        Additionally, efforts to make literature more inclusive emerged, with
        the development of Braille for the visually impaired and the creation of
        spoken books, providing alternative ways for individuals to access and
        enjoy literature.
